The `miner` API allows you to remote control the nodeâ€™s mining operation and set various mining specific settings.

## miner_getHashrate
Get your hashrate in H/s (Hash operations per second).

## miner_setExtra
Sets the extra data a miner can include when miner blocks. This is capped at 32 bytes.

## miner_setGasPrice
Sets the minimal accepted gas price when mining transactions. Any transactions that are below this limit are excluded from the mining process.

## miner_start
Start the CPU mining process with the given number of threads and generate a new DAG if need be.

## miner_stop
Stop the CPU mining operation.

## miner_setEtherbase
Sets the etherbase, where mining rewards will go.

## miner_setGasLimit
Sets the gas limit the miner will target when mining. Note: on networks where EIP-1559 is activated, this should be set to twice what you want the gas target (i.e. the effective gas used on average per block) to be.
