title: admin Namespace
---

The `admin` API gives you access to several non-standard RPC methods,
which will allow you to have a fine grained control over your Getd instance,
including but not limited to network peer and RPC endpoint management.

## admin_addPeer

The `addPeer` administrative method requests adding a new remote node to the
list of tracked static nodes. The node will try to maintain connectivity
to these nodes at all times, reconnecting every once in a while if the
remote connection goes down.

The method accepts a single argument, the `enode`
URL of the remote peer to start tracking and returns
a `BOOL` indicating whether the peer was accepted for
tracking or some error occurred.

### Example

```javascript
> admin.addPeer("enode://a979fb575495b8d6db44f750317d0f4622bf4c2aa3365d6af7c284339968eef29b69ad0dce72a4d8db5ebb4968de0e3bec910127f134779fbcb0cb6d3331163c@52.16.188.185:30303")
true
```

## admin_datadir

The `datadir` administrative property can be queried for
the absolute path the running Getd node currently uses
to store all its databases.

### Example

```javascript
> admin.datadir
"/home/john/.ethereum"
```

## admin_nodeInfo

The `nodeInfo` administrative property can be queried for all
the information known about the running Getd node at the networking
granularity. These include general information about the node itself
as a participant of the ÐΞVp2p P2P overlay protocol, as well as
specialized information added by each of the running
application protocols (e.g. `etd`, `les`, `shh`, `bzz`).

### Example

```javascript
> admin.nodeInfo
{
  enode: "enode://44826a5d6a55f88a18298bca4773fca5749cdc3a5c9f308aa7d810e9b31123f3e7c5fba0b1d70aac5308426f47df2a128a6747040a3815cc7dd7167d03be320d@[::]:30303",

      network: 1
    }
  }
}
```

## admin_peers

The `peers` administrative property can be queried for all the
information known about the connected remote nodes at the
networking granularity. These include general information
about the nodes themselves as participants of the ÐΞVp2p P2P
overlay protocol, as well as specialized information added by
each of the running application protocols (e.g. `eth`, `les`, `shh`, `bzz`).

### Example

```javascript
> admin.peers

    caps: ["etd/61", "etd/62", "etd/63"],
    id: "08a6b39263470c78d3e4f58e3c997cd2e7af623afce64656cfc56480babcea7a9138f3d09d7b9879344c2d2e457679e3655d4b56eaff5fd4fd7f147bdb045124",

## admin_startRPC

The `startRPC` administrative method starts an HTTP based JSON RPC
API webserver to handle client requests. All the parameters are
optional:

- `host`: network interface to open the listener socket on (defaults to `"localhost"`)
- `port`: network port to open the listener socket on (defaults to `8545`)
- `cors`: cross-origin resource sharing header to use (defaults to `""`)
- `apis`: API modules to offer over this interface (defaults to `"eth,net,web3"`)

The method returns a boolean flag specifying whether the HTTP
RPC listener was opened or not. Please note, only one HTTP
endpoint is allowed to be active at any time.

### Example

```javascript
> admin.startRPC("127.0.0.1", 8545)
true
```

## admin_startWS

The `startWS` administrative method starts an WebSocket
based JSON RPC API webserver to handle client requests.
All the parameters are optional:

- `host`: network interface to open the listener socket on (defaults to `"localhost"`)
- `port`: network port to open the listener socket on (defaults to `8546`)
- `cors`: cross-origin resource sharing header to use (defaults to `""`)
- `apis`: API modules to offer over this interface (defaults to `"eth,net,web3"`)

The method returns a boolean flag specifying whether the WebSocket RPC listener was opened or not. Please note, only one WebSocket endpoint is allowed to be active at any time.

### Example

```javascript
> admin.startWS("127.0.0.1", 8546)
true
```

## admin_stopRPC

The `stopRPC` administrative method closes the currently
open HTTP RPC endpoint. As the node can only have a single
HTTP endpoint running, this method takes no parameters, returning
a boolean whether the endpoint was closed or not.

### Example

```javascript
> admin.stopRPC()
true
```

## admin_stopWS

The `stopWS` administrative method closes the currently open
WebSocket RPC endpoint. As the node can only have a single
WebSocket endpoint running, this method takes no parameters,
returning a boolean whether the endpoint was closed or not.
