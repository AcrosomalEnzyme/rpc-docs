## Requirements

### Windows and MacOS
In order to install the block chain on your local computer, you need to install docker on your local machine.
The simplest way to install docker is to use the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
After installing docker, you can check your installation by using the command `docker run hello-world`.


### Ubuntu

In order to install docker on your Ubuntu System, you may use the command `sudo apt install docker.io`, 
and command `sudo apt install docker-compose` on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04.

### Other linux operatings systems

Please follow the oficial [docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).


## Installation

After installing docker, you can download the latest release of the blockchain from 
our [Github](https://github.com/sirily11/eth-localnet.git).

**First you need to clone the repository**

`
git clone https://github.com/sirily11/eth-localnet.git
`

**Then you pull the pre-built image from docker hub**

`
docker pull sirily11/etd-privatenet
`


**Finally you can run the container**

<Callout>Please check the envfile section to setup the required env variables</Callout>

`
docker-compose up -d worker
`



This command will start the etd worker in background. If you want to follow the logs 
produced by the container, you can run the command 
`docker-compose logs -f worker`.


## Install other services

We have provided a docker-compose file that can be used to start the other services. 
The list of the services avaiable is:

- admin: a simple web interface to manage the blockchain
- etdstats_node: A node that collect the statistics of the blockchain and send it to our blockchain [browser](https://stats.etd.zone)

You can start the services by running the command `docker-compose up -d service_name`.

For example, `docker-compose up -d admin` will start admin service on your local computer.

## Auto update

To use our auto-update script, you need to install pm2 first. In order to install pm2, you need to install latest nodejs.
After installing nodejs, you can run the command `npm install pm2 -g`. And in our project directory, run command
`pm2 start app.json`. This will run our auto-update script in background. To start the auto-update script at start-up,
you can use command `pm2 startup` to achieve that.

## Env Files

In order to boot our block chain correctly, you need to have an `.env` file in your local folder with following values:
```
etd_websocket=wss://{your etdstats server's websocket url | Optional}
etd_password={Your etdstats server's websocket password | Optional}
etd_node_name={Your etdstats server's node name and admin's username | Required}
etd_node_id={Your etdstats server's node id and admin's password | Required}
etd_coinbase={Your wallet address}
etd_max_peers={Maximum peers number | Optional}
etd_secure_rpc=true
```

If you change `etd_node_id` or `etd_node_name`, 
you need to re-build your admin container `docker-compose build admin` to apply changes.
